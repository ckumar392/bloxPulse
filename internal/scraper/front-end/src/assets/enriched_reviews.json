Thanks to the DNS module and IPAM, your hand becomes very strong in the internal and external network, literally not without it. I didn't see a feature that I was uncomfortable with. Just getting the product certificates is a little troublesome. Using Infoblox as DNS, we can add A and PTR records which are helpful for lookup and reverse lookup.",

Your easy way to create a network container and a lot of IP addresses import the sheet. Your easy way to search for an IP address is through several organizations and many network IP Addresses in your environment. The best part is DNS, DHCP and IPAM in one dashboard and with full visibility.The best part is number of ip is import this solution , sometimes ip not subneting these gives error. I have deployed this solution Bloxone DDI in the organization; its one part DNS is disliked coustmer, say lots of domain name you import one organization sometimes you open one domain it's more time to take the open. BloxOne DDI is solving the problem in most DNS parts. Sometimes you  forward domain and the reverse domain is import the DDI solution, and you open the one domain It takes more time, and you refresh the sometimes not work.",

    "Postcontent": "NIOS is one of the solutions provided by Infoblox for core network services such as DNS, DHCP and IPAM services.  It is a consolidated service managed as one in a single platform. Infoblox NIOS provides visibility across your network by consolidating data from DNS and DHCP services and eventually forming what they called the \"single source of truth.\" which is the IPAM. It is easy to use in management since all configurations must be done on a single platform, even without direct access to appliances distributed across the network. Even though Infoblox provides robust DDI services and in terms of functionality, they are much farther from their competitor. The drawback here is how they price their product. The cost of their solution is directly proportional to their development. We are having difficulty positioning their product because of the higher cost. Sometimes, we prefer to offer another solution that can comply with clients' budgets. In today's network, most solutions reside on the cloud. If not started with the cloud, they are slowly migrating to the cloud because of cost issues and the benefits of having a solution in the cloud. Most clients are also moving to the cloud and planning on getting services through the cloud. Infoblox is currently solving this one on how they can provide the client's needs. Because this Infoblox NIOS is an on-prem solution, they are now offering the first cloud-based management of DDI. With the help of this, we have our chance now to position this kind of solution.",
