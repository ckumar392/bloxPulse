    "Postcontent": "What do you like best about Infoblox NIOS?\nNIOS is one of the solutions provided by Infoblox for core network services such as DNS, DHCP and IPAM services.  It is a consolidated service managed as one in a single platform. Infoblox NIOS provides visibility across your network by consolidating data from DNS and DHCP services and eventually forming what they called the \"single source of truth.\" which is the IPAM. It is easy to use in management since all configurations must be done on a single platform, even without direct access to appliances distributed across the network.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Infoblox NIOS?\nEven though Infoblox provides robust DDI services and in terms of functionality, they are much farther from their competitor. The drawback here is how they price their product. The cost of their solution is directly proportional to their development. We are having difficulty positioning their product because of the higher cost. Sometimes, we prefer to offer another solution that can comply with clients' budgets.\n\nWhat problems is Infoblox NIOS solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIn today's network, most solutions reside on the cloud. If not started with the cloud, they are slowly migrating to the cloud because of cost issues and the benefits of having a solution in the cloud. Most clients are also moving to the cloud and planning on getting services through the cloud. Infoblox is currently solving this one on how they can provide the client's needs. Because this Infoblox NIOS is an on-prem solution, they are now offering the first cloud-based management of DDI. With the help of this, we have our chance now to position this kind of solution.",
